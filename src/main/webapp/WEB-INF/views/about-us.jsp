<h1>
	Welcome

Experience IT Alumni has come a long way from its beginnings as an ideal for a final project. 
When the four (then,Experience IT students) first started out, 
their goal (providing an additional communication hub for recent acceptees, 
and current Experience IT students), drove them to do more with their project;
and decided to turn hard work and inspiration, into to an on-going way to keep students motivated, inspired,
and connected with those who can relate to someone in their seat. 
We are thrilled to have this ideal become more than a project, 
and hope that it becomes another great asset in the Experience IT and Grand Circus community.
